Welcome to Financial Analytics with R: Building a Laptop Laboratory for Data Science
by Mark J. Bennett and Dirk L. Hugen from Cambridge University Press!

It is best to send inquiries directly to us at mjbenntt@uiowa.edu or dirklhugen@gmail.com
rather than Cambridge University Press.

Organization:

The code for each Chapter is in a file called code.R.
Associated datasets are also contained in each directory. 

Ticker symbols contained in literal constants in the book do become obsolete occasionally.
The most common event that causes this is when these publicly traded companies are acquired.
The tseries package routine get.hist.quote() will no longer quote prices
after this happens even though the prices existed up until the acquisition.

In order to approximate the book results, it is best to replace the ticker that
was absorbed (and no longer quoted) with the surviving ticker. During 2016-2018 these
ticker changes occurred and the code.R files have been updated accordingly.

http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/6172457.htm is about PCP -> BRK-B.
Note: for Yahoo's get.hist.quote() we used BRK-B but for Quandl market prices we now use BRK-B.

http://www.kindermorgan.com/content/docs/KMI_Summary_Transaction_Information.pdf
is about KMP -> KMI.

http://investors.danaher.com/2015-08-31-Danaher-Completes-Acquisition-Of-Pall-Corporation
is about PLL -> DHR.

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/13/verizon-completes-yahoo-acquisition-marissa-mayer-resigns.html
is about YHOO -> VZ

https://seekingalpha.com/news/3332795-priceline-renames-booking-holdings-new-ticker-coming-soon
is about PCLN -> BKNG from Feb 27 2018 forward

Errata:

errata:
p. 20  'factor' should be 'fac' three places in the second boxes block of code.
p. 24  A given B should be B given A
p. 32  middle page Cor(X,Y) definition: denominator should be sqrt(Var(X))*sqrt(Var(Y))
p. 37  Formula 3.35 remove the capital Sigma left of =. Formula 3.36 should be
       Cor(R_j,R_k) = Cov(R_j,R_k)/(sigma_j sigma_k)
p. 62  Top line of code should be wInc <- w/sum(w)*amtToRealloc.
p. 64  Former errata sheet(s) had get.hist.quote() disabled, however, it is again operational.
p. 64  Upper code block replace 'YHOO" with 'AAPL' since YHOO no longer independent.
p. 70  'len <- 1006' becomes 'len <- length(get.hist.quote("NVDA",start="2010-02-17",
                                            end="2014-02-14",quote="AdjClose"))'
p. 70  Middle of page: start='2010-02-18' becomes start='2010-02-17' two places.
p. 75  Repace code block final 2 lines with:
       #unit test: 
       library(tseries)
       get.hist.quote("BRK-B",start="2016-05-01",end="2017-05-01",quote="Adj")
       pdf <- getHistPrices(c('BKNG','MCD'),c(.5,.5),251,
              start="2013-02-15",end="2014-02-14")
       pdf
p. 90  Vector c(-0.0339, -0.0351, 0.0000, 0.0690, 0.0645 -0.0317) with missing comma should be 
       c(-0.0339, -0.0351, 0.0000, 0.0690, 0.0645, -0.0317)
p. 90  Exercise 5.2 sigmaZ should be .0007
p. 92 to 97: * these code blocks no longer run because getSymbol() from library(quantmod)
       because the facility, ichart.finance.yahoo.com, no longer operates. Meanwhile
       the output of these code blocks are still seen in the book.
       No other code in Chapter 6 is affected from the remainder of Section 6.1 onward.
p. 98  Middle page equation Y_t-1 + Y_t-1 should be Y_t-1 + Y_t-2 and Y_t on left side
       should have a hat on it.
p. 101 Line 3 the number 15 should be 25.
p. 110 Middle page 'then we say that Y_t is an' should be
       'then we say that W_t is an'.
p. 110 Middle page equation Y_t-1 + Y_t-1 should be Y_t-1 + Y_t-2 and W_t on left
       side should have a hat on it.
p. 110 Middle page equations Y_t should have a hat on it two places.
p. 111 Line 13 up from bottom of page replace p = 1 with q = 1 for MA component
p. 111 End of 1st paragraph: remove "at the alpha = 1 percent level but not at
       the alpha = 5 percent level."
p. 127 Formula 6.14 should be 0.00005246/(1-.1397-.7698) = 0.0005796685
p. 128 Exercise 6.1 (e) should be: pacf() instead of acf()
p. 128 Exercise 6.1 (g) should be: Examine the model residuals with a histogram
       hist(residuals(m.boardings),breaks=20) and test
       for normalityshapiro.test(residuals(m.boardings))
p. 129 Exercise 6.3 (g) should be Plot the fitted model conditional
       variance: plot((fitted(m2)[,1])^2,type='l'
p. 130 line 8 'pass' should be 'passer'
p. 133 after l <- stockdata$info[1:D,1] add:
       for(i in 1:D)  #Need to splitAdjust():
         p[,i] <- splitAdjust(p[,i],l[i])
       This change is necessary because findR() only side affects a matrix named
       prices via the '<<-' global assignment operator and so does not side affect p.
p. 133 replace .035 with .057 in code block 6th line from the bottom
p. 134 replace Figure 7.2 with the following:
```

The version of pruneBySharpe() below is invoked with a p (prices) matrix
that has been split-adjusted so the threshold changes from .035 to .057
to maintain our top 102 stocks in terms of Sharpe Ratio.
The revised pruneBySharpe() also returns all three major result objects in a list().
```{r pruneBySharpe}
pruneBySharpe <- function(prices,lab,meanv,sdevv,threshSR,mufree=0) {
  par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
  par(mfrow=c(1,2))
  indepSharpes <- (meanv-mufree)/sdevv
  len = length(indepSharpes)
  plot(indepSharpes,ylab="SR",col=4)
  plot(sort(indepSharpes),ylab="SR",col=4)
  lines(1:len,rep(threshSR,len))
  indHighSharpes <- (indepSharpes > threshSR)
  #clean up NAs
  for(d in 1:length(indHighSharpes)) #clean up NAs
    if(is.na(indHighSharpes[d]))
      indHighSharpes[d] <- FALSE
  len = dim(prices)[1]
  wid = dim(prices)[2]
  smallerSz = sum(indHighSharpes)
  newPrices <- matrix(rep(0,len*smallerSz),
              nrow=len,ncol=smallerSz)
  newLab    <- vector(length=smallerSz)
  e <- 1
  for(d in 1:wid) {
    if(indHighSharpes[d]) {
      if(F) print(paste("e",e))
      newPrices[,e] <- prices[,d]
      newLab[e] <- lab[d]
      e <- e + 1
    }
  }
  print("completed Sharpe pruning")
  list(newPrices,newLab,indepSharpes)
